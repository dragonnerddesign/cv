              <li>Created a Gantt chart and checklist for our mobilisations process so that we could provide
                a more streamlined plan of attack for each new contract. It is also helpful to keep us on track
                when we have multiple contracts on the go. </li>
              <li>Completing a mindtools workshop in house to give me the tools and techniques to review a
                process or system that I feel is not working and make a recommendation as to how to improve it.
                These tool include mind mapping, “now, where, how” and Pareto (80/20 rule) as well as the knowledge
                of how to present my findings in a one page action plan. I am looking into how we can better
                communicate with all parties involved to increase the awareness around asset capture and maintenance
                and why it is important to the wider business.</li>
              <li>When the asset capture program was introduced I created documentation around how it would be
                implemented into our current work flow and work instructions around how to do certain tasks. I am also
                the teams point of contract for questions they may have around the program.</li>
